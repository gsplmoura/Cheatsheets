### **Cheatsheets: An R Project for Quick Reference Guides**

**Cheatsheets** is an R project designed to provide a collection of quick-reference guides for essential R packages, functions, and workflows. This project serves as a **handy companion** for R users who need concise, well-organized information without searching through extensive documentation.

### **ðŸ“Œ Features**

-   **Comprehensive Cheatsheets**: Covers core R topics, including data wrangling (`dplyr`), visualization (`ggplot2`), statistical modeling, and reproducible reports (`Quarto`, `RMarkdown`).
-   **Concise & Practical**: Each cheatsheet provides essential syntax, common use cases, and best practices.
-   **Tidyverse-Centric**: Emphasizes modern, readable workflows using the `tidyverse` ecosystem.
-   **Code-First Approach**: Includes ready-to-use code snippets for immediate application.
-   **Customization Ready**: Users can modify and extend the cheatsheets to fit their own research or teaching needs.

### **ðŸ”§ Technologies Used**

-   R + Tidyverse (`ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `readr`, `purrr`, etc.)
-   RMarkdown / Quarto for document generation
-   Git for version control
-   VS Code / RStudio for development

This project aims to streamline R usage by offering **structured, easy-to-navigate, and actionable reference materials**. ðŸš€
