|---------|-------|------------------------------------------|
| \[, 1\] | mpg   | Miles/(US) gallon                        |
| \[, 2\] | cyl   | Number of cylinders                      |
| \[, 3\] | disp  | Displacement (cu.in.)                    |

| \[, 5\] | drat  | Drive ratio (or rear axle ratio) \*      |
| \[, 6\] | wt    | Weight (1000 lbs)                        |
| \[, 7\] | qsec  | time in sec to complete a quarter mile   |
| \[, 8\] | vs    | Engine (0 = V-shaped, 1 = straight)      |
| \[, 9\] | am    | Transmission (0 = automatic, 1 = manual) |
| \[,10\] | gear  | Number of forward gears                  |
| \[,11\] | carb  | Number of carburetors                    |

\* Drive ratio refers to the ratio of the number of rotations of the driveshaft to one full rotation of the rear wheels. A higher `drat` means the engine needs **more** rotations to turn the wheels once, which can provide **better acceleration** but may reduce fuel efficiency.

# Basics

**ggplot2** is based on the **grammar of graphics**, the idea that you can build every graph from the same components: (1) a **data** set, a (2) **coordinate system**, and (3) **geoms** --- visual marks that represent data points.

```{r}
last_plot() # Returns the last plot.

ggsave("plot.png", width = 5, height = 5) # Saves last plot as 5' x 5' file named "plot.png" in working directory. Matches file type to file extension.

```

To display values, **map** *variables in the data* to *visual properties of the geom* (**aesthetics**) like **size**, **color**, and **x** and **y** locations.

Complete the template below to build a graph.

ggplot(data = ) + #required: data \<geom\_...\>(mapping = aes(<Mappings>), #required: geom function & aes mapping stat = <Stat>, position = <Position> + <Coordinate_Function> + <Facet_Function> + <Scale_Function> + <Theme_Function>

**Data, a Geom Function, and Aes Mappings are required.** Stat, Position, and the Coordinate, Facet, Scale, and Theme functions are not required and will supply sensible defaults.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) # no geom_function
  # Begins a plot that you finish by adding layers to.
  # Add one geom function per layer.
```

## Common aes() values

### color and fill

String (`"red"`, `"#RRGGBB"`).

### linetype

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

# Create a data frame with different line types, inverted order
linetypes_df <- data.frame(
  x = rep(1, 7),
  y = 6:0,  # Ensures values from 6 to 0
  linetype = factor(6:0, labels = c("twodash", "longdash", "dotdash", 
                                    "dotted", "dashed", "solid", "blank"))
)

# Create the plot
ggplot(linetypes_df, aes(x = x, y = y, linetype = linetype)) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = 2, xend = 3, y = y, yend = y), size = 1.5) +  # Draws the lines
  scale_linetype_manual(values = 0:6) +  # Assigns line types
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = 6:0, labels = c("twodash (6)", "longdash (5)", "dotdash (4)", 
                                                  "dotted (3)", "dashed (2)", "solid (1)", "blank (0)")) +  # Ensures all 7 tick labels
  labs(title = "ggplot2 linetypes", 
       x = NULL, y = NULL) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    axis.line.x = element_blank(),  # Removes x-axis line
    axis.ticks.x = element_blank(), # Removes x-axis ticks
    axis.text.x = element_blank(),  # Removes x-axis labels
    legend.position = "none"
  ) 

```

### size

Integer (in mm for size of points and text).

### linewidth

Integer (in mm for widths of lines).

### shape

Integer/shape name or a single character (`"a"`).

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

# Create a data frame with different shape types
shapes_df <- data.frame(
  x = rep(1, 26),
  y = 0:25,  # Reverse order to display top to bottom
  shape = factor(0:25, labels = c(
    "square open (0)", "circle open (1)", "triangle open (2)", "plus (3)",
    "cross (4)", "diamond open (5)", "triangle down open (6)", "square cross (7)",
    "asterisk (8)", "diamond plus (9)", "circle plus (10)", "star (11)",
    "square plus (12)", "circle cross (13)", "square triangle (14)", "square (15)",
    "circle (16)", "triangle (17)", "diamond (18)", "circle small (19)",
    "bullet (20)", "circle filled (21)", "square filled (22)", "diamond filled (23)",
    "triangle filled (24)", "triangle down filled (25)"
  ))) # Ensure exactly 25 labels


# Create the plot
ggplot(data = shapes_df) +
  geom_point(mapping = 
             aes(
               x = x, 
               y = y,
               shape = shape),size = 2.2) +
  scale_shape_manual(values = 0:25) +  # Assigns shape values
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = 25:0, labels = rev(levels(shapes_df$shape))) +  # Ensures all tick labels
  labs(title = "ggplot2 shapes", x = NULL, y = NULL) +
  theme_minimal(base_line_size = 0.2) +
    theme(
    axis.line.x = element_blank(),  # Removes x-axis line
    axis.ticks.x = element_blank(), # Removes x-axis ticks
    axis.text.x = element_blank())  # Removes x-axis labels

```

# Geom primitives

1.  Use a geom function to represent data points;
2.  Use the geom's aesthetic properties to represent variables;
3.  Each function returns a layer.

### geom_blank()

The *base code `n_unemploy`* where examples will be built is based on the `economics` dataset.

Note that running `n_unemploy` displays the base coordinate system with the variables `date` in the x axis and `unemploy` in the y axis. However, no actual data is plotted, since no `geom_` function was specified.

```{r}
n_unemploy <- ggplot(data = economics, aes(x = date, y = unemploy))
    # x = date        <date> 1967-07-01,...   Month of data collection
    # y = unemploy    <dbl> 2944,...          Number of unemployed (in thousands)

n_unemploy # Note that running 
```

The blank geom draws nothing, but can be a useful way of ensuring common scales between different plots. See expand_limits() for more details.

Returns the same result as the *base code `n_unemploy`*

```{r}
n_unemploy + geom_blank()

# OR 

ggplot(data = economics) +
  geom_blank(aes(x = date, y = unemploy))

```

### Connecting observations

geom_path() connects the observations in the order in which they appear in the data. geom_line() connects them in order of the variable on the x axis. geom_step() creates a stairstep plot, highlighting exactly when changes occur.

geom_polygon(): Polygons are very similar to paths (as drawn by geom_path()) except that the start and end points are connected and the inside is coloured by fill.

So use geom_path() for an unfilled polygon, geom_polygon() for a filled polygon and geom_ribbon() for a polygon anchored on the x-axis.

#### geom_path()

Before we look at `geom_path`, let's just take a look at a standard scatter plot to get a sense of the data.

```{r}
n_unemploy + geom_point()

# OR 

ggplot(data = economics) +
  geom_point(aes(x = date, y = unemploy))
```

`geom_path()` connects the observations in the *order in which they appear* in the data. The `group` aesthetic determines which cases are connected together.

`aes()` arguments: `x`, `y`, `alpha`, `color`, `group`, `linetype`, `size`.

Usage:

```         
geom_path(
  mapping = NULL,
  data = NULL,
  stat = "identity",
  position = "identity",
  ...,
  lineend = "butt",
  linejoin = "round",
  linemitre = 10,
  arrow = NULL,
  na.rm = FALSE,
  show.legend = NA,
  inherit.aes = TRUE
)
```

Arguments:

-   `lineend`: Line end style ("round", "butt", "square").

-   `linejoin`: Line join style ("round", "mitre", "bevel").

-   `linemitre`: Line mitre limit (number greater than 1). Obs. miter/mitre: (joint) chanfro de 45 graus

```{r}
n_unemploy + geom_path(lineend = "butt", linejoin = "mitre", linemitre = 1)

# OR 

ggplot(data = economics) +
  geom_path(aes(x = date, y = unemploy)) # in this case no arguments are specified.

```

Other functions used to **connect observations** are:

-   `geom_line()` connects them in order of the variable on the x axis

-   `geom_step()` creates a stairstep plot, highlighting exactly when changes occur.

#### geom_polygon()

Polygons are very similar to paths (as drawn by `geom_path()`) except that the *start and end points are connected* and *the inside is coloured by fill*. The *group aesthetic* determines which cases are connected together into a polygon.

It is possible to draw polygons with holes by providing a subgroup aesthetic that differentiates the outer ring points from those describing holes in the polygon.

`aes()` arguments: `x`, `y`, `alpha`, `color`, `fill`, `group`, `subgroup`, `linetype`, `size`.

-   relevant: `fill`, `subgroup`

```         
geom_polygon(
  mapping = NULL,
  data = NULL,
  stat = "identity",
  position = "identity",
  rule = "evenodd",
  ...,
  na.rm = FALSE,
  show.legend = NA,
  inherit.aes = TRUE
)
```

```{r}
n_unemploy + geom_polygon()

# OR 

ggplot(data = economics) +
  geom_polygon(aes(x = date, y = unemploy))

```

#### geom_ribbon() & geom_area()

For each x value, `geom_ribbon()` displays a y interval defined by `ymin` and `ymax`.

`aes()` arguments: `x`, `ymin`, `ymax`, `alpha`, `color`, `fill`, `group`, `linetype`, `size`.

-   relevant: `ymin`, `ymax`, `outline.type`

`geom_area()` is a special case of geom_ribbon(), where the *`ymin` is fixed to 0 and y is used instead of ymax*.

```{r}

n_unemploy + geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = unemploy - 900, ymax = unemploy + 900))

# OR 

ggplot(data = economics) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(x = date, y = unemploy, 
                  ymin = unemploy - 900, ymax = unemploy + 900))
                         
```

### expand_limits()

Expands the plot limits using data. Sometimes you may want to ensure limits include a single value, for all panels or all plots. This function is a thin wrapper around `geom_blank()` that makes it easy to add such values.

```{r}
mpg_wt <- ggplot(data = mtcars, # 11 numerical variables for 32 automobiles
                 aes(x = mpg, y = wt)) + geom_point()

mpg_wt

```

```{r}
mpg_wt + expand_limits(x = 0) 

# OR

ggplot(data = mtcars) +
  geom_point(aes(x = mpg, y = wt)) +
  expand_limits(x = 0)
```

```{r}
mpg_wt + expand_limits(y = c(1, 9)) 

# OR

ggplot(data = mtcars) +
  geom_point(aes(x = mpg, y = wt)) +
  expand_limits(y = c(1, 9))
```

```{r}
mpg_wt + expand_limits(x = 0, y = 0) 

# OR

ggplot(data = mtcars) +
  geom_point(aes(x = mpg, y = wt)) +
  expand_limits(x = 0, y = 0)

```

```{r}
mpg_wt + expand_limits(x = c(0,40), y = c(0,10))

# OR

ggplot(data = mtcars) +
  geom_point(aes(x = mpg, y = wt)) +
  expand_limits(x = c(0,40), y = c(0,10))

```

**SEAL DATASET**

```{r}
seal_lat <- ggplot(data = seals, aes(x = long, y = lat))
    # x = long        <dbl>                   Geographical longitude where the seal was recorded
    # y = lat         <dbl>                   Geographical latitude where the seal was recorded 

seal_lat + geom_point()
```

### Line segments and curves

#### geom_segment() & geom_curve()

`geom_segment()` draws a straight line from `(x, y)` to `(xend, yend)`.

`geom_curve()` draws a curved line from `(x, y)` to `(xend, yend)`. See the underlying drawing function `grid::curveGrob()` for the parameters that control the curve. `aes()` arguments: `x`, `xend`, `y`, `yend`, `alpha`, `angle`, `color`, `curvature`, `linetype`, `size`.

```{r}
seal_lat + geom_segment(aes(yend = lat + 1, xend = long + 1)) # Draw a straight line from `(x, y)` to `(xend, yend)`.

seal_lat + geom_curve(aes(yend = lat + 1, xend = long + 1), curvature = 1)


ggplot() +
  geom_curve(aes(x = 2.62, xend = 3.57, y = 21.0, yend = 15.0, colour = "curve")) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = 2.62, xend = 3.57, y = 21.0, yend = 15.0, colour = "segment"))


wt_mpg <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg)) +
  geom_point()

os_curve <- data.frame(x1 = 2.62, x2 = 3.57, y1 = 21.0, y2 = 15.0)

wt_mpg +
  geom_curve(aes(x = x1, y = y1, xend = x2, yend = y2, colour = "curve"), data = os_curve, arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.05, "npc"))) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = x1, y = y1, xend = x2, yend = y2, colour = "segment"), data = os_curve)

```

#### geom_spoke()

geom_spoke() is a polar parameterisation of geom_segment(). It is useful when you have variables that describe direction and distance. The angles start from east and increase counterclockwise.

Draw line segments using polar coordinates (`angle` and `radius`).

```{r}
seal_lat + geom_spoke(aes(angle = 1:1155, radius = 1)) # Draw line segments using polar coordinates (`angle` and `radius`).
```

#### geom_rect()

-   \``: Draw a rectangle by connecting four corners (`xmin`,`xmax`,`ymin`,`ymax`).`aes()`arguments:`xmax`,`xmin`,`ymax`,`ymin`,`alpha`,`color`,`fill`,`linetype`,`size\`.

```{r}
seal_lat + geom_rect(aes(xmin = long, ymin = lat, xmax = long + 1, ymax = lat + 1))
```

### Reference lines: horizontal, vertical, and diagonal

These geoms add reference lines (sometimes called rules) to a plot, either horizontal, vertical, or diagonal (specified by slope and intercept). These are useful for annotating plots.

Common aesthetics: `x`, `y`, `alpha`, `color`, `linetype`, `size`, `linewidth`.

#### geom_abline()

Draw a diagonal reference line with a given `slope` and `intercept`.

```{r}
ggplot() + geom_abline(aes(intercept = 0, slope = 1)) # Draw a diagonal reference line with a given `slope` and `intercept`.
```

#### geom_hline()

Draw a horizontal reference line with a given `yintercept`.

```{r}
seal_lat + geom_hline(aes(yintercept = lat)) # Draw a horizontal reference line with a given `yintercept`.
```

#### geom_vline()

Draw a vertical reference line with a given `xintercept`.

```{r}
seal_lat + geom_vline(aes(xintercept = long)) # Draw a vertical reference line with a given `xintercept`.
```

# One Variable

## Continuous

```{r}
hwy <- ggplot(
  data = mpg, # Fuel economy data from 1999 to 2008 for 38 popular models of cars.
  aes(hwy)) # Highway miles per gallon

hwy
```

### geom_area()

Draw an area plot.

`aes()` arguments: `x`, `y`, `alpha`, `color`, `fill`, `linetype`, `linewidth`.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(hwy)) + geom_area(stat = "bin")
```

### geom_density()

`?geom_density()` Computes and draws *kernel* density estimate, which is a smoothed version of the histogram. This is a useful alternative to the histogram for continuous data that comes from an underlying smooth distribution.

The term *kernel* refers to the smoothing function used in *Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)*. KDE is a method for estimating the *probability density function (PDF)* of a continuous random variable. It provides a smooth estimate of the distribution of the data, as opposed to a histogram, which is more discrete. The kernel function determines the shape of the weighting function applied to each data point.

See `?density` for a list of available kernels: *"gaussian", "epanechnikov", "rectangular", "triangular", "biweight", "cosine", "optcosine"*. Defaults to "gaussian". The "gaussian" kernel means that each data point contributes to the density estimate with a weight given by the Gaussian function (a normal distribution curve centered on each point). The bandwidth (which controls the amount of smoothing) is also crucial and can be adjusted with the `bw` argument.

`aes()` arguments: `x`, `y`, `alpha`, `color`, `fill`, `group`, `linetype`, `linewidth`, `weight`.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(hwy)) + geom_density(kernel = "gaussian")
```

See output of different kernels:

```{r}
gaussian <- ggplot(data = mpg, aes(hwy)) + geom_density(kernel = "gaussian") + 
  ggtitle("Gaussian Kernel")

epanechnikov <- ggplot(data = mpg, aes(hwy)) + geom_density(kernel = "epanechnikov") + 
  ggtitle("Epanechnikov Kernel")

rectangular <- ggplot(data = mpg, aes(hwy)) + geom_density(kernel = "rectangular") + 
  ggtitle("Rectangular Kernel")

triangular <- ggplot(data = mpg, aes(hwy)) + geom_density(kernel = "triangular") + 
  ggtitle("Triangular Kernel")

# Arrange in a 2×2 grid
gridExtra::grid.arrange(gaussian, epanechnikov, rectangular, triangular, nrow = 2, ncol = 2)
```

### geom_dotplot()

`?geom_dotplot()` draws a dot plot. In a dot plot, the width of a dot corresponds to the bin width (or maximum width, depending on the binning algorithm), and dots are stacked, with each dot representing one observation.

`aes()` arguments: `x`, `y`, `alpha`, `color`, `fill`.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(hwy)) + geom_dotplot()
```

### geom_qq()

`?geom_qq()` draws a quantile-quantile plot.

`geom_qq()` and `stat_qq()` produce quantile-quantile plots. `geom_qq_line()` and `stat_qq_line()` compute the slope and intercept of the line connecting the points at specified quartiles of the theoretical and sample distributions.

`aes()` arguments: `x`, `y`, `alpha`, `color`, `fill`, `linetype`, `size`, `weight`.

```{r}
ggplot(mpg) + 
  geom_qq(aes(sample = hwy)) + 
  geom_qq_line(aes(sample = hwy))
```

### Histograms and frequency polygons

Visualise the distribution of a single continuous variable by *dividing the x axis into bins* and counting the number of observations in each bin. Histograms display the counts with bars and frequency polygons display the counts with lines.

#### geom_freqpoly()

`?geom_freqpoly()` draws a frequency polygon.

*Frequency polygons are more suitable when you want to compare the distribution across the levels of a categorical variable* (rather than stacking histograms)

`aes()` arguments: `x`, `y`, `alpha`, `color`, `group`, `linetype`, `linewidth`.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(hwy, colour = fl)) + geom_freqpoly()
```

#### geom_histogram()

Draw a histogram. `aes()` arguments: `x`, `y`, `alpha`, `color`, `fill`, `linetype`, `linewidth`, `weight`.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(hwy)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 5)
```

Note that `binwidth` greatly affects the result

```{r}
histogram_1 <- ggplot(data = mpg, aes(hwy)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) + 
  ggtitle("Binwidth = 1")

histogram_2 <- ggplot(data = mpg, aes(hwy)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 2) + 
  ggtitle("Binwidth = 2")

histogram_3 <- ggplot(data = mpg, aes(hwy)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 3) + 
  ggtitle("Binwidth = 3")

histogram_5 <- ggplot(data = mpg, aes(hwy)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 5) + 
  ggtitle("Binwidth = 5")

# Arrange in a 2×2 grid
gridExtra::grid.arrange(histogram_1, histogram_2, histogram_3, histogram_5, nrow = 2, ncol = 2)
```

### geom_boxplot()

`?geom_boxplot()` draws a box and whiskers plot (in the style of Tukey). The boxplot compactly displays the distribution of a continuous variable. It visualises five summary statistics (the median, two hinges and two whiskers), and all "outlying" points individually.

Usage

```{r, eval=FALSE, error=FALSE}

geom_boxplot(
  mapping = NULL,
  data = NULL,
  stat = "boxplot",
  position = "dodge2",
  ...,
  outliers = TRUE,
  outlier.colour = NULL,
  outlier.color = NULL,
  outlier.fill = NULL,
  outlier.shape = 19,
  outlier.size = 1.5,
  outlier.stroke = 0.5,
  outlier.alpha = NULL,
  notch = FALSE,
  notchwidth = 0.5,
  staplewidth = 0,
  varwidth = FALSE,
  na.rm = FALSE,
  orientation = NA,
  show.legend = NA,
  inherit.aes = TRUE)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(hwy)) + geom_boxplot()
```



## Discrete

### geom_bar()

There are two types of bar charts: `geom_bar()` and `geom_col()`:

**geom_bar():**

-   geom_bar() makes the height of the bar proportional to the number of cases in each group (or if the weight aesthetic is supplied, the sum of the weights).
-   geom_bar() automatically counts the occurrences of each category. So, it internally creates a `y = count variable`. geom_bar() uses stat_count() by default: it counts the number of cases at each x position.

**geom_col():**

-   If you want the heights of the bars to represent values in the data.
-   geom_col() `requires y explicitly`. So, it's described in `Two variables, one discrete, one continuous`. Unlike geom_bar(), it does not count occurrences automatically.
-   geom_col() uses stat_identity(): it leaves the data as is.
-   *use with pre-summarized data (e.g., counts, averages)*

`?geom_bar()` draws a bar chart.

`aes()` arguments: `x`, `alpha`, `color`, `fill`, `linetype`, `linewidth`, `weight`.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(class)) + # Fuel type
  geom_bar()
```

# Two Variables
## Both Continuous

### Text

Text geoms are useful for labeling plots. **They can be used by themselves as scatterplots** OR in *combination with other geoms*, for example, for *labeling points* or for *annotating the height of bars*.

-   `?geom_text()` adds only text to the plot.
-   `?geom_label()` draws a rectangle behind the text, making it easier to read.
-   `aes()` arguments: - `x`, `y`, `label`, `alpha`, `angle`, `color`, `family`, `fontface`, `hjust`, `lineheight`, `size`, `vjust`.

#### geom_label()

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(cty, hwy)) + 
  
  geom_label(aes(label = cty), nudge_x = 1, nudge_y = 1)
```

#### geom_text()

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(cty, hwy)) + 
  
  geom_text(aes(label = cty), nudge_x = 1, nudge_y = 1)
```

### geom_point()

`?geom_point()` draws a scatter plot.

`aes()` arguments: `x`, `y`, `alpha`, `color`, `fill`, `shape`, `size`, `stroke`.

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(cty, hwy)) + 
  
  geom_point()
```

### geom_smooth()

`?geom_smooth()` plots *smoothed conditional means*. It aids the eye in seeing patterns in the presence of overplotting. `geom_smooth()` and `stat_smooth()` are effectively aliases: they both use the same arguments. Use stat_smooth() if you want to display the results with a non-standard geom.

`aes()` arguments: `x`, `y`, `alpha`, `color`, `fill`, `group`, `linetype`, `linewidth`, `weight`.

`method` argument: - *defaults* to local regression: `loess` for small datasets, `gam` for larger ones. The trend line is nonlinear and flexible, adapting to data patterns. Best for identifying general trends in a dataset without assuming a linear relationship. - `method = lm` uses linear regression, assuming a linear relationship between x and y and fitting a straight line. Best for when you expect a linear relationship between variables or want to compare with a linear regression model.


```{r}
smooth_df <- ggplot(mpg, aes(cty, hwy)) + geom_point() + ggtitle("Default") + geom_smooth() 

smooth_lm <- ggplot(mpg, aes(cty, hwy)) + geom_point() + ggtitle("method = lm") + geom_smooth(method = lm)

gridExtra::grid.arrange(smooth_df, smooth_lm, nrow = 1, ncol = 2)
```

| Feature | Default geom_smooth() | geom_smooth(method = lm) |
|----------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Method | LOESS (for small datasets) or GAM | Linear Regression (LM) |
| Trend Line Shape | Flexible, nonlinear | Straight, linear |
| Best for | Exploring trends in non-linear relationships | Testing linear relationships |
| Computation Speed | Slower for large datasets | Faster, since it’s just a straight line |
| Assumptions | No assumption on data shape | Assumes linearity |

Which method to use?

- Use default geom_smooth() when you are exploring the data and don’t want to impose a linear assumption.
- Use geom_smooth(method = lm) when you are specifically testing a linear model or need a clear comparison of a straight-line fit.

**Tip**: To see the equation of the fitted regression model, you can use `stat_smooth(method = lm, formula = y ~ x, se = FALSE)` and extract model coefficients separately using lm().

### geom_rug()

`?geom_rug()` is used to add `marginal distributions` to a plot by drawing small tick marks (or “rugs”) along the axes. It provides an additional layer of information, showing the distribution of data points along one or both axes. It supplements a 2d display with the two 1d marginal distributions. Rug plots display individual cases so are best used with smaller datasets.

obs. A `marginal distribution` is the distribution of a single variable in a multivariate dataset, obtained by summing (or integrating) over the other variables (like summing the observations in a 2x2 table to find the total). It provides insight into how a single variable behaves regardless of other variables. In the context of bivariate (2D) data, you have two variables, say X and Y. The marginal distribution of X is obtained by ignoring Y and looking only at the values of X, and vice versa.

Why use `geom_rug()`?

1.  *Enhance Density Information* – It helps visualize the concentration of data points, particularly in scatter plots or density plots.
2.  Identify *Data Clusters* – It highlights where data points are densely packed.
3.  Detect *Outliers* – Isolated ticks indicate sparse data regions or potential outliers.
4.  Provide a Compact *Alternative to Histograms* – Instead of a full marginal histogram, geom_rug() offers a minimalistic way to show distributions.

`aes()` arguments: `x`, `y`, `alpha`, `color`, `linetype`, `linewidth`,

Add rugs to axis using the `sides` argument. - sides = "b" → Bottom (x-axis) - sides = "l" → Left (y-axis) - sides = "t" → Top - sides = "r" → Right

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(cty, hwy)) + 
  geom_point() +
  
  geom_rug(sides = "bl", color = "black", alpha = 0.5)
```

### geom_quantile()

`?geom_quantile()` *fits a quantile regression* to the data and draws the fitted quantiles with lines. This is as a continuous analogue to geom_boxplot().

Instead of modeling the mean (as in linear regression), quantile regression estimates conditional quantiles of the response variable. Unlike `geom_smooth()`, which estimates the mean trend, `geom_quantile()` shows how different quantiles of the response variable change across the predictor variable. Additionally, unlike `geom_smooth()`, it does not assume a normal distribution and provides insights into **distribution tails**.

By *default*, it fits a *linear quantile regression* using `method = "rq"` from the {quantreg} package. But you may also use a *Nonlinear Quantile Regression* using `method = "rqss"` (smoothing splines). In the latter, `lambda` controls the smoothness of the fit.

When to use:

-   Skewed or heteroscedastic data – when variance changes across x.
-   Identifying trends in different quantiles – instead of focusing only on the mean.
-   Robust alternative to linear regression – quantile regression is less sensitive to outliers.

`aes()` arguments: `x`, `y`, `alpha`, `color`, `group`, `linetype`, `linewidth`, `weight`.

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(cty, hwy)) + 
  geom_point() +
  
  geom_quantile()
  # Defaults to:
  # geom_quantile(quantiles = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75))
```

| Feature | geom_smooth() | geom_quantile() |
|-------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| Regression Type | Least Squares Regression (Mean) | Quantile Regression |
| Trend Estimate | Mean response | Conditional quantiles (e.g., median, 10th, 90th percentile) |
| Best For | Identifying central trends | Examining distributions across different percentiles |
| Example Use Cases | General trend analysis | Analyzing skewed data, outliers, or heteroscedasticity |

*Comparing `geom_smooth` and `geom_quantile`*

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(cty, hwy)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = lm) +
  geom_quantile(quantiles = c(0.5), color = "red")
```

## One Discrete, One Continuous

```{r}
f <- ggplot(mpg, aes(class, hwy))
```

### geom_col()

`?geom_col()` draws a bar plot. 

`aes()` arguments: `x`, `y`, `alpha`, `color`, `fill`, `group`, `linetype`, `linewidth`.

```{r} 
ggplot(mpg, aes(class, hwy)) + geom_col()
```
What is geom_col() doing in this plot?

- The x aesthetic is mapped to class (car class categories).
- The y aesthetic is mapped to hwy (highway miles per gallon).
- Each bar height represents the sum of hwy values for each class.

Why is this happening?

Unlike `geom_bar()`, which counts occurrences in a categorical variable, `geom_col()` uses the actual values in the y aesthetic. So in this case, geom_col() is summing up the hwy values for each car class.

What Might Be the Issue?

- `hwy` is not a single value per class — it’s a numeric variable with multiple observations per class.
- The bars in the plot show the `sum of all hwy values` for each class, which may not be the intended representation.

How to Fix It?

If you want to show the `mean` highway MPG per class instead of the sum, use `stat = "summary"` inside geom_bar():
- `geom_bar(stat = "summary")` tells ggplot to *summarize hwy instead of counting occurrences*.
- `fun = mean` ensures the mean highway MPG is plotted for each class.

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(class, hwy)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "summary", fun = "mean")
```
Why Not `geom_col()`?
	
-	`geom_col()` expects pre-aggregated data (i.e., y must already be a computed value).
- If you want to use `geom_col()`, you must pre-calculate the mean

```{r}
mpg_summary <- mpg %>%
  group_by(class) %>%
  summarize(mean_hwy = mean(hwy))

ggplot(mpg_summary, aes(class, mean_hwy)) +
  geom_col()
```

### geom_boxplot() 

`?geom_boxplot()` draws a `box and whiskers plot` (in the style of Tukey). The boxplot compactly displays the distribution of a *continuous variable*. It visualises five summary statistics (the median, two hinges and two whiskers), and all "outlying" points individually.

`aes()` arguments: `x`, `y`, `lower`, `middle`, `upper`, `ymax`, `ymin`, `alpha`, `color`, `fill`, `group`, `linetype`, `shape`, `linewidth`, `weight`.

```{r} 
ggplot(mpg, aes(class, hwy)) + 
  
  geom_boxplot()
```

What does this do?

-	`class` is mapped to the `x-axis` (*categorical* variable).
-	`hwy` is mapped to the `y-axis` (*numeric* variable).
-	Creates separate boxplots for each car class, showing the distribution of highway MPG (hwy) within each category.

So, although boxplots are used used to sumarrize continuous data, if you map a discrete value to either `x` or `y`, it will show the distribution within each category.
	
### geom_dotplot() 

Draw a dot plot. Similarly to `geom_boxplot`, mapping a `discrete` variable do `x` means you will create multiple dot plots (one for each class), allowing comparison of hwy distributions across car classes.

`aes()` arguments: `x`, `y`, `alpha`, `color`, `fill`, `group`.

```{r} 
ggplot(mpg, aes(class, hwy)) + 
  
  geom_dotplot(binaxis ="y", stackdir = "center")
```

### geom_violin() 

`?geom_violin()` draws a violin plot. A violin plot is a *compact display of a continuous distribution*. It is a blend of `geom_boxplot()` and `geom_density()`: a violin plot is a *mirrored density plot displayed in the same way as a boxplot*.

`aes()` arguments: `x`, `y`, `alpha`, `color`, `fill`, `group`, `linetype`, `linewidth`, `weight`.

```{r} 
ggplot(mpg, aes(class, hwy)) + 
  
  geom_violin(scale = "area")
```

## Both Discrete

g <- ggplot(diamonds, aes(cut, color))
```

-   `g + geom_count()`: Plot a count of points in an area to address over plotting. `aes()` arguments: `x`, `y`, `alpha`, `color`, `fill`, `shape`, `size`, `stroke`.

-   `i + geom_line()`: Connect data points, ordered by the x axis variable. `aes()` arguments: `x`, `y`, `alpha`, `color`, `group`, `linetype`, `linewidth`.

-   `i + geom_step(direction = "hv"`: Draw a stairstep plot. `aes()` arguments: `x`, `y`, `alpha`, `color`, `group`, `linetype`, `linewidth`.

## Visualizing Error

df <- data.frame(grp = c("A", "B"), fit = 4:5, se = 1:2)
j <- ggplot(df, aes(grp, fit, ymin = fit - se, ymax = fit + se))
```

nc <- sf::st_read(system.file("shape/nc.shp", package = "sf"))
ggplot(nc) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = AREA))
```

# Stats

An alternative way to build a layer.

A stat builds new variables to plot (e.g., count, prop).

Visualize a stat by changing the default stat of a geom function, `geom_bar(stat = "count")`, or by using a stat function, `stat_count(geom = "bar")`, which calls a default geom to make a layer (equivalent to a geom function). Use `after_stat(name)` syntax to map the stat variable `name` to an aesthetic.

```{r}
i + stat_density_2d(aes(fill = after_stat(level)), geom = "polygon")
```

In this example, `"polygon"` is the geom to use, `stat_density_2d()` is the stat function, `aes()` contains the geom mappings, and `level` is the variable created by stat.

-   `hwy stat_bin(binwidth = 1, boundary = 10)`: `x`, `y` \| `count`, `ncount`, `density`, `ndensity`

-   `hwy stat_count(width = 1)`: `x`, `y` \| `count`, `density`

-   `hwy stat_density(adjust = 1, kernel = "gaussian")`: `x`, `y` \| `count`, `density`, `scaled`

-   `ggplot(mpg, aes(cty, hwy)) stat_bin_2d(bins = 30, drop = T)`: `x`, `y`, `fill` \| `count`, `density`

-   `ggplot(mpg, aes(cty, hwy)) stat_bin_hex(bins =30)`: `x`, `y`, `fill` \| `count`, `density`

-   `ggplot(mpg, aes(cty, hwy)) stat_density_2d(contour = TRUE, n = 100)`: `x`, `y`, `color`, `linewidth` \| `level`

-   `ggplot(mpg, aes(cty, hwy)) stat_ellipse(level = 0.95, segments = 51, type = "t")`

-   `l + stat_contour(aes(z = z))`: `x`, `y`, `z`, `order` \| `level`

-   `l + stat_summary_hex(aes(z = z), bins = 30, fun = max)`: `x`, `y`, `z`, `fill` \| `value`

-   `l + stat_summary_2d(aes(z = z), bins = 30, fun = mean)`: `x`, `y`, `z`, `fill` \| `value`

-   `ggplot(mpg, aes(class, hwy)) + stat_boxplot(coef = 1.5)`: `x`, `y` \| `lower`, `middle`, `upper`, `width`, `ymin`, `ymax`

-   `ggplot(mpg, aes(class, hwy)) + stat_ydensity(kernel = "gaussian", scale = "area")`: `x`, `y` \| `density`, `scaled`, `count`, `n`, `violinwidth`, `width`

-   `ggplot(mpg, aes(cty, hwy)) stat_ecdf(n = 40)`: `x`, `y` \| `x`, `y`

-   `ggplot(mpg, aes(cty, hwy)) stat_quantile(quantiles = c(0.1, 0.9), formula = y ~ log(x), method = "rq")`: `x`, `y` \| `quantile`

-   `ggplot(mpg, aes(cty, hwy)) stat_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ x, se = T, level = 0.95)`: `x`, `y` \| `se`, `x`, `y`, `ymin`, `ymax`

-   `ggplot() + xlim(-5, 5) + stat_function(fun = dnorm, n = 20, geom = "point")`: `x` \| `x`, `y`

-   `ggplot() + stat_qq(aes(sample = 1:100))`: `x`, `y`, `sample` \| `sample`, `theoretical`

-   `ggplot(mpg, aes(cty, hwy)) stat_sum()`: `x`, `y`, `size` \| `n`, `prop`

-   `ggplot(mpg, aes(cty, hwy)) stat_summary(fun.data = "mean_cl_boot")`

-   `h + stat_summary_bin(fun = "mean", geom = "bar")`

-   `ggplot(mpg, aes(cty, hwy)) stat_identity()`

-   `ggplot(mpg, aes(cty, hwy)) stat_unique()`

# Scales

Override defaults with **scales** package.

**Scales** map data values to the visual values of an aesthetic. To change a mapping, add a new scale.

```{r}
n <- ggplot(mpg, aes(fl)) + geom_bar(aes(fill = fl))

n + scale_fill_manual(
  values = c("skyblue", "royalblue", "blue", "navy"),
  limits = c("d", "e", "p", "r"),
  breaks =c("d", "e", "p", "r"),
  name = "fuel", 
  labels = c("D", "E", "P", "R")
)
```

In this example, `scale_` specifies a scale function, `fill` is the aesthetic to adjust, and `manual` is the prepackaged scale to use.

`values` contains scale-specific arguments, `limits` specifies the range of values to include in mappings, `breaks` specifies the breaks to use in legend/axis, and `name` and `labels` specify the title and labels to use in the legend/axis.

### General Purpose Scales

Use with most aesthetics.

-   `scale_*_continuous()`: Map continuous values to visual ones.

-   `scale_*_discrete()`: Map discrete values to visual ones.

-   `scale_*_binned()`: Map continuous values to discrete bins.

-   `scale_*_identity()`: Use data values as visual ones.

-   `scale_*_manual(values = c())`: Map discrete values to manually chosen visual ones.

-   `scale_*_date(date_labels = "%m/%d", date_breaks = "2 weeks")`: Treat data values as dates.

-   `scale_*_datetime()`: Treat data values as date times. Same as `scale_*_date()`. See `?strptime` for label formats.

### X & Y Location Scales

Use with x or y aesthetics (x shown here).

-   `scale_x_log10()`: Plot `x` on log10 scale.

-   `scale_x_reverse()`: Reverse the direction of the x axis.

-   `scale_x_sqrt()`: Plot `x` on square root scale.

### Color and Fill Scales (Discrete)

-   `n + scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Blues")`: Use color scales from ColorBrewer. For palette choices `RColorBrewer::display.brewer.all()`.

-   `n + scale_fill_grey(start = 0.2, end = 0.8, na.value = "red")`: Use a grey gradient color scale.

### Color and Fill Scales (Continuous)

```{r, eval}
o <- ggplot(data = mpg, aes(hwy)) + geom_dotplot(aes(fill = ..x..))
```

-   `o + scale_fill_distiller(palette = "Blues")`: Interpolate a palette into a continuous scale.

-   `o + scale_fill_gradient(low = "red", high = "yellow")`: Create a two color gradient.

-   `o + scale_fill_gradient2(low = "red", high = "blue", mid = "white", midpoint = 25)`: Create a diverging color gradient.

-   `o + scale_fill_gradientn(colors = topo.colors(6))`: Create a n-color gradient. Also `rainbow()`, `heat.colors()`, `terrain.colors()`, `cm.colors()`, `RColorBrewer::brewer.pal()`.

### Shape and Size Scales

```{r}
p <- ggplot(mpg, aes(cty, hwy)) + geom_point(aes(shape = fl, size = cyl))
```

-   `p + scale_shape() + scale_size()`: Map discrete values to shape and size aesthetics.

-   `p + scale_shape_manual(values = c(3:7))`: Map discrete values to specified shape values.

-   `p + scale_radius(range = c(1,6))`: Map values to a shape's radius.

-   `p + scale_size_area(max_size = 6)`: Like `scale_size()` but maps zero values to zero size.

Shapes used here are the same as the ones listed in the Aes section.

# Coordinate Systems

```{r}
u <- ggplot(mpg, aes(fl)) + geom_bar()
```

-   `u + coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 5))`: `xlim`, `ylim`. The default Cartesian coordinate system.

-   `u + coord_fixed(ratio = 1/2)`: `ratio`, `xlim`, `ylim`. Cartesian coordinates with fixed aspect ration between x and y units.

-   `ggplot(mpg, aes(y = fl)) + geom_bar()`: Flip Cartesian coordinates by switching x and y aesthetic mappings.

-   `u + coord_polar(theta = "x", direction = 1)`: `theta`, `start`, `direction`. Polar coordinates.

-   `u + coord_trans(y = "sqrt")`: `x`, `y`, `xlim`, `ylim`. Transformed Cartesian coordinates. Set `xtrans` and `ytrans` to the name of a window function.

-   `π + coord_sf()`: `xlim`, `ylim`, `crs`. Ensures all layers use a common Coordinate Reference System.

# Position Adjustments

Position adjustments determine how to arrange geoms that would otherwise occupy the same space.

```{r}
s <- ggplot(mpg, aes(fl, fill = drv))
```

-   `s + geom_bar(position = "dodge")`: Arrange elements side by side.

-   `s + geom_bar(position = "fill")`: Stack elements on top of one another, normalize height.

-   `ggplot(mpg, aes(cty, hwy)) + geom_point(position = "jitter")`: Add random noise to X and Y position of each element to avoid over plotting.

-   `ggplot(mpg, aes(cty, hwy)) + geom_label(position = "nudge")`: Nudge labels away from points.

-   `s + geom_bar(position = "stack")`: Stack elements on top of one another.

Each position adjustment can be recast as a function with manual `width` and `height` arguments:

```{r}
s + geom_bar(position = position_dodge(width = 1))
```

# Themes

-   `u + theme_bw()`: White background with grid lines.

-   `u + theme_gray()`: Grey background with white grid lines (default theme).

-   `u + theme_dark()`: Dark grey background and grid lines for contrast.

-   `u + theme_classic()`: No grid lines.

-   `u + theme_light()`: Light grey axes and grid lines.

-   `u + theme_linedraw()`: Uses only black lines.

-   `u + theme_minimal()`: Minimal theme.

-   `u + theme_void()`: Empty theme.

-   `u + theme()`: Customize aspects of the theme such as axis, legend, panel, and facet properties.

```{r}

# Faceting

Facets divide a plot into subplots based on the values of one or more discrete variables.

```{r}
t <- ggplot(mpg, aes(cty, hwy)) + geom_point()
```

-   `t + facet_grid(. ~ fl)`: Facet into a column based on fl.

-   `t + facet_grid(year ~ .)`: Facet into rows based on year.

-   `t + facet_grid(year ~ fl)`: Facet into both rows and columns.

-   `t + facet_wrap(~ fl)`: Wrap facets into a rectangular layout.

-   `t + facet_grid(drv ~ fl, scales = "free")`: Set **scales** to let axis limits vary across facets. Also `"free_x"` for x axis limits adjust to individual facets and `"free_y"` for y axis limits adjust to individual facets.

Set **labeller** to adjust facet label:

-   `t + facet_grid(. ~ fl, labeller = label_both)`: Labels each facet as "fl: c", "fl: d", etc.

-   `t + facet_grid(fl ~ ., labeller = label_bquote(alpha ^ .(fl)))`: Labels each facet as "𝛼^c^", "𝛼^d^", etc.

# Labels and Legends

Use `labs()` to label elements of your plot.

```         
t + labs(x = "New x axis label", 
  y = "New y axis label",
  title ="Add a title above the plot",
  subtitle = "Add a subtitle below title",
  caption = "Add a caption below plot",
  alt = "Add alt text to the plot",
  <Aes> = "New <Aes> legend title")
```

-   `t + annotate(geom = "text", x = 8, y = 9, label = "A")`: Places a geom with manually selected aesthetics.

-   `p + guides(x = guide_axis(n.dodge = 2))`: Avoid crowded or overlapping labels with `guide_axis(n.dodge or angle)`.

-   `n + guides(fill = "none")`: Set legend type for each aesthetic: `colorbar`, `legend`, or `none` (no legend).

-   `n + theme(legend.position = "bottom")`: Place legend at "bottom", "top", "left", or "right".

-   `n + scale_fill_discrete(name = "Title", labels = c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E"))`: Set legend title and labels with a scale function.

# Zooming

-   `t + coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 100), ylim = c(10,20))`: Zoom without clipping (preferred).

-   `t + xlim(0, 100) + ylim(10, 20)` or `t + scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 100)) + scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 100))`: Zoom with clipping (removes unseen data points).
